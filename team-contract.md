Goals

What are the goals of the team?
    Making an efficient and organized system, where everyone contributed significantly.
What are your personal goals for this assignment?
    Design better and cleaner implementations and test cases, and learn as much as possible of team software engineering.
What obstacles might you encounter in reaching your goals?
    Differing availability, differing levels of comfortability with the skills required to complete tasks at hand
What happens if all of you decide you want to get an A grade, but because of time constraints, one person decides that a B will be acceptable?
    The team will sit down to discuss this thoroughly, for we know each other beforehand and we are all willing to be reasonable with one another.
Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others in order to get the team an A?
    No: this is completely unacceptable, and the team members doing extra work will be sure to communicate with staff if it is necessary,

Meeting and communication norms

How will you use the in-class time?
    Great time to plan/organize work for the week and consult each other on issues/questions with respective tasks.
How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class time? How long do you anticipate meetings will be?
    The goal as of now is to meet twice a week, staying several hours on the meeting to thoroughly discuss progress.
When and where (online) will outside-class meetings be held?
    Meeting will be held in the Student Center and on Zoom for convenience.
How will you communicate outside of meetings? (Email list? Realtime messaging platform?)
    We will be communicating mostly through text message SMS and group phone calls. 

Work norms

How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
    15-20 hours
How will work be divided among team members? (Show how you filled in the boxes from the project handout.)
    Iteration 1: 
        Puzzle adt: diego
        Parser: emma
        Server: sam
        Drawing: sam
        Client adt: emma
        Interaction: diego
    Iteration 0:
        Puzzle adt: emma, sam
        Grammar: diego, sam
        Web api: diego, emma
        Drawing: diego, emma
        Client adt: diego, sam
        Integration: emma, sam
Where will you record who is responsible for which tasks? (Including future tasks that come up over the course of the project.)
    Progress and actionables will be recorded in a Google Docs, where we will list the tasks completed since the last meeting and the tasks to complete by the next.
How will deadlines be set?
    We will discuss before we begin working what deadlines we want to set for ourselves and when we want to have checkpoints
What will happen if someone does not follow through on a commitment (e.g., missing a deadline, not showing up to meetings)?
    We will have a serious meeting outside of our regular meetings (we all know where each other live)
How will the work be reviewed?
    At each meeting, we will discuss each team member's progress in assessing how we will allocate work for the following week.
What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?
    We will have a serious meeting outside of our regular meetings (we all know where each other live)
How will you deal with different work habits of individual team members (e.g., some people like to get assignments done as early as possible; others like to work under the pressure of a deadline)?
    Having much smaller and more frequent internal deadlines so that, by each meeting, regardless of how early/late a team member prefers to meet deadlines, will be done.

Decision-making

Do you need consensus (100% approval of all team members) before making a decision?
    It depends on the decision - certain details of implementations, if reasonably minute, could be decisions that can pass with no consensus. However, significant changes to the implementations on the main branch of the project should be approved by consensus. All in all, more often than not, consensus is absolutely necessary.
What will you do if one of you fixates on a particular idea?
    We will sit down to discuss said idea together, and vow to be willing to make compromises if the team majority decides against one of our ideas.
